# Words Matter

## Scope

This is a simple docker container that walks through a directory and changes any
instance of `Master` to `Leader`. As a bonus, it also does the same thing with 
`Slave` to `Follower`.

The idea is that this can create a PR for repos via GitHub Actions so we as developers
can have bots make sure we start to take these words out of our vocabulary.

## Usage 

If you want to run the container:
```bash
docker build -t words-matter .
cd <to source code>
docker run -v $PWD:/mnt words-matter
```
